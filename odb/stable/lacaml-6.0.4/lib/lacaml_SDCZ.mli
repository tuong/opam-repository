(** Binding to the {{:http://www.netlib.org/blas/}BLAS} and
    {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/}LAPACK} libraries.  You can make
    use of this library by referring to the corresponding module you
    need for your precision and number type:
    {[
    open Lacaml.S
    open Lacaml.D
    open Lacaml.C
    open Lacaml.Z]}

    To use this library, you should be familiar with BLAS and LAPACK.  The
    following {{:http://www.netlib.org/blas/blasqr.ps}quick reference
    guide for the BLAS} and
    {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapackqref.ps}LAPACK quick
    reference} may be useful to you.  For the precise description of
    the functions, consult the man pages
    {{:http://www.math.utah.edu/software/lapack/}online} or, if you
    {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/manpages.tgz}installed} them on
    your machine (if you use Linux, they should be in the packages of
    your distribution), read them with Emacs: [M-x man] (under Unix)
    or [M-x woman] (all systems).
