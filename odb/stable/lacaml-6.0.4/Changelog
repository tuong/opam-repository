2012-02-28:  Previous configuration bug fix did not work correctly, should
             be solved now.

2012-02-24:  Fixed a configuration bug on non-Linux Unix-platforms that
             prevented corrected linking.

2012-02-01:  New major release version 6.0.0!

               1) Switched build process to Oasis
               2) Removed module Impl in favor of a flat module hierarchy

             As a consequence of 2) instead of the following:

               open Lacaml.Impl.D

             The new way of opening double-precision functions is:

               open Lacaml.D

2011-08-09:  Fixed a bug in the work space calculation of sbev.

             Thanks to Yichen Xie <yxie@cs.stanford.edu> for contributing
             this function!

2011-06-25:  Added new function:

               * sbev

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this function!

2011-03-23:  Greatly improved API documentation.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this large patch!

             Renamed a function for consistency.  This breaks
             backward-compatibility, but is extremely unlikely to affect
             anybody so no major release:

               * Common.mat_of_vec -> Common.mat_from_vec

2010-11-21:  Added new function:

               * sbgv

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this function!

2009-10-03:  Minor API change.

             trmm and trsm now have a similar API wrt. variable labeling.

2009-09-21:  Added new functions:

               * ormqr
               * trsm
               * Mat.scal_rows

               * sygv

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing sygv!

               * orgqr
               * lauum

             Added example for QR-factorization.

2009-09-09:  Fixed a few performance bugs.

             Some matrix and vector types were polymorphic, thus
             leading to much worse element access speed.

             Improved compiler selection in Makefile.

             Improved some matrix operations.

             Added new function:

               * Mat.transpose_copy

2009-06-13:  Added new function:

               * Mat.as_vec

2009-06-12:  Added new function:

               * tbtrs  (all numbers)

             Thanks to Sam Ehrlichman <sehrlichman@janestreet.com>
             for contributing the patch!

2009-06-07:  Added workaround for OCaml performance bug wrt. bigarray
             access.  This should make OCaml code perform much faster when
             accessing or modifying bigarrays directly.

             Changed API for Mat.scal_cols by swapping matrix and vector
             argument.

2009-06-01:  New vector functions:

               * Vec.sqrt  (compute square roots of a vector)
               * Vec.sqr   (compute squares of a vector)

2009-05-30:  Major overhaul:

             Fixed too liberal transpose parameters in several
             functions.  The conjugate transpose was not available
             in some.

             Make convenience definitions for pp_num, pp_vec, pp_mat
             available on opening Lacaml.Impl.{S,D,C,Z} to be able
             to print more generically.

             Added new functions:

               * dotu  (only for complex numbers)
               * dotc  (only for complex numbers)
               * ger   (all numbers)
               * lassq
               * Mat.syrk_trace
               * Mat.symm2_trace

             Fixed several functions to allow for complex multipliers:
             gemv, gbmv, symv, gemm, symm, trmm, syrk, syr2k.

             Added new "stable" flag to Vec.sqr_nrm2 if over/underflow
             protection is required.

             Numerous internal improvements to make adding functionality
             even easier and to improve performance and numeric
             stability.

2009-05-16:  Added new function:

               * Mat.syrk_diag

             Renamed functions and changed API:

               * Mat.prod_diag -> Mat.gemm_diag
               * Mat.prod_trace -> Mat.gemm_trace

2009-05-03:  Added new functions:

               * Vec.neg

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing the patch!

2009-04-28:  Added new functions:

               * Mat.prod_diag
               * Mat.prod_trace

2009-04-25:  Major API changes:

             Removed function:

               * Mat.copy (use lacpy instead)

             Modified function:

               * geev (differently named arguments)

             Added functions:

               * lacpy (also copies triangular matrices)
               * larnv (random number generation)

             Fixed Mac OS X build problems.

             Lots of internal cleanups.

2009-04-23:  Improved numerical stability of Vec.ssqr for real numbers
             and zero mean.

2009-04-22:  Added new matrix function:

               * scal_cols

2009-01-21:  Added Vec.sqr_nrm2, which is numerically more stable than
             Vec.ssqr.  Added nrm2 for complex numbers (BLAS-1 function).

2009-01-14:  Greatly improved defaults for printing in toplevels.

2009-01-13:  Added context printing options to matrices.  This feature
             allows human-readable printing of huge matrices by only
             emitting specified horizontal and vertical contexts.

2008-11-12:  Improved Windows portability.

2008-11-10:  Fixed dynamic linking problem on Mac OS X.

2008-11-02:  Added new BLAS functions:

               * tpmv
               * tpsv

2008-11-01:  Added new BLAS function:

               * syr2k

               * packed
               * unpacked

2008-10-15:  Added new LAPACK function:

               * geqrf

2008-09-21:  Added new BLAS and LAPACK functions:

               * trmm
               * trtrs
               * trtri

             Some minor API cleanups and internal improvements.

2008-09-17:  Added optional jitter argument to potrf, potrs, and potri.

2008-09-08:  !!! WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!

             potri and potrs now implicitly call potrf by default!
             This will break previous code depending on these functions,
             but should be trivial to fix.  This change was deemed
             necessary, because otherwise switching between sytri/potri
             and sytrs/potrs would cause surprises: the purely symmetric
             functions do already implicitly call the factorization
             unless a default parameter (ipiv) is overridden.

             Sorry for the inconvenience.

2008-07-21:  Generalized Mat.transpose to support specifying sub-matrices.

2008-04-23:  Fixed a parameter checking bug for syevr-related functions.

2008-04-11:  Added new BLAS function:

               * trmv

             Thanks to Martin Willensdorfer <ma.wi@gmx.at> for the patch!

2008-02-13:  Fixed a bug when implicitly allocating result matrices
             with user-specified offsets.  It may cause segfaults and
             affects many functions (though it is presumably very rarely
             triggered).

             Thanks to Shun Sakuraba <shun.sakuraba@gmail.com> for
             contributing this patch!

2008-01-11:  Fixed installation of new release.  Added new function:

               * Mat.detri

2008-01-02:  New major release due to restructuring.  The library is now
             packed into a separate namespace (Lacaml), and the previously
             visible Lacaml-module is now called "Impl".

2007-12-27:  Added new BLAS function:

               * symv

2007-11-22:  Added Mat.scal and Mat.axpy.

2007-11-21:  Fixed a bug in vector iteration functions related to
             negative index increments.  Thanks to Fabrice Pardo
             <Fabrice.Pardo@lpn.cnrs.fr> for reporting!

             Greatly improved performance of matrix copying.  Cleaned up
             some code.  Removed dependency on F2C library (gfortran
             should nowadays be linked implicitly).

2007-03-30:  Added lacaml_utils to installed interfaces.

2007-03-28:  Fixed potential GC-bugs.  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-11-22:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-09-15:  Fixed bug on 64bit architectures: Fortran integers are
             32bit only, Lacaml did not account for that.

2006-07-24:  Tightened parameter checks on functions that accept square
             matrices only to prevent LAPACK from complaining (i.e. raise
             OCaml exceptions instead).

2006-07-06:  Added Vec.concat.

2006-06-08:  Fixed some GC-bugs.  Cleaned up C-code.

2006-01-21:  Updated copy of f2c.h to fix size-related bugs on AMD64.
             Fixed some warnings introduced by OCaml-3.09.

2006-01-18:  Fixed a bug in pbsv and sbmv.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing the patch!

               * Vec.random  (for both real and complex numbers)

2005-08-24:  Added a new function:

               * Vec.append

2005-07-15:  Fixed two documentation generation bugs.

2005-07-14:  Major release (version 3)!

             The API has been significantly normalized, simplified and
             documented to make its use more convenient.

             ATTENTION: THE ORDER OF VECTOR ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTION AXPY
             HAS CHANGED, AND PARAMETER X IS LABELED.  IF YOUR COMPILER
             DOES NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT MISSING LABELS, YOUR PROGRAM WILL
             COMPILE BUT PRODUCE WRONG RESULTS.  ALWAYS LABEL PARAMETER
             X FOR AXPY, WHICH IS ALSO MUCH MORE READABLE.

             New LAPACK-function:

               * gesvd for complex numbers

                 Thanks to Egbert Ammicht <eammicht@lucent.com> for
                 this contribution!

2005-05-31:  Fixed a couple of GC-related bugs pointed out by Saffire (an
             FFI-type checker).

2005-05-27:  New function in Mat-module:

               * mvec_to_array

             labels.

2005-03-28:  Fixed a bug in Mat.of_col_vecs.

2005-03-28:  New functions in Mat-module:

               * of_col_vecs

2005-03-23:  Added a toplevel-specific module for installing
             pretty-printers, which is automatically loaded when requiring
             the library in the toplevel.

2005-03-22:  Added a new constant parameter to function Vec.ssqr_diff.

2005-03-10:  New functions in Mat-module:

             New functions in Mat-module:

               * copy
               * of_diag
               * col

             Fixed too tight type restrictions of axpy.

             Corrected error locations.

             Tightened some parameter checks, and made them more modular.

             Changed function interfaces (not backward compatible):

               * Mat.init_row
               * Mat.init_col

             Changed the "trans"-parameter in various functions from
             a boolean to type "trans2" or "trans3", which consist of
             constructors "`N", "`T", "`C" depending on them making
             sense in this context.

             New matrix functions:

               * Mat.dim1
               * Mat.dim2

                 This function was initially contributed by Oleg Trott
                 <ot14@columbia.edu>.

             Removed obsolete file myXerbla.c.

             Cleaned up examples.

             Improved documentation a bit.

2004-02-21:  Added CAMLprim in the C-interface where appropriate.

             Made Vec.min and Vec.max use the 2-norm for comparison.
             Removed a superfluous debug statement.
             Updated OCamlMakefile.

2003-12-19:  Fixed a severe bug in Vec.fold.

             Improved element-wise vector division (prevent overflow).

             Added two functions for generating matrices:

               * init_rows
               * init_cols

             Improved functionality of Vec.iter and Vec.iteri.

2003-12-18:  Update to allow shared libraries.

2003-12-16:  Changed Fortran error handling to catch invalid arguments
             that OCaml did not detect.

2003-12-15:  Fixed a bug in the examples (lin_eq).

2003-12-14:  Changed the signature of a couple of functions: non-optional
             arguments that are overwritten and represent the result of
             the function will not be returned anymore (unit-functions).

             Relaxed the conditions of the license to allow static
             linking.

2003-12-12:  Released new major version. Please note new module names!

             Added support for complex transforms.
             Allow accessing submatrices using labels.

             Updated OCamlMakefile.
             Changed stub names (invisible to user).

2003-01-07:  Updated OCamlMakefile to make use of "findlib".

2002-09-12:  Updated OCamlMakefile and license.

             Documented all modules for use with ocamldoc.

2002-07-24:  Incorporated further extensions by Christophe Troestler.

             Fixed a couple of C-compiler warnings (pedantic mode).

2002-07-16:  Fixed potential problem with threads and GC.

2002-07-12:  Added loads of new LAPACK- and BLAS-functions!

             Many thanks to

               Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>

             for this major contribution!

2002-07-03:  Small fix in wrong type declaration in C-code (has no effect
             at runtime).

2002-05-05:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2002-05-04:  Revised the whole installation procedure. See INSTALL for
             details.

2002-04-30:  Updated OcamlMakefile: it does not ask for confirmation
             during installation anymore!

2002-04-23:  Added the file "f2c.h" to the distribution so that people
             don't have to install it.

2002-02-10:  Removed project from Sourceforge for simpler maintainance.

2002-01-04:  Changed the example a little bit to show users functionality
             from module "Vec_D" (i.e. basic vector operations).

2002-01-02:  Removed two more unneeded object files from the f2c-library.
             (Thanks to John Malecki for the hint!).

2001-09-06:  Removed labels referring to standard library modules from the
             implementation: will be deprecated in the next OCaml-release.

2001-06-30:  Removed "Printexc.catch" from lin_reg-example: is going to be
             deprecated in upcoming OCaml-release.

             Bumped major version number: the existing functionality of
             the library seems stable enough.

2001-04-03:  Minor change to make things compile in label mode.

2001-03-30:  Added annotation "noalloc" to functions that benefit from it.
             This lets OCaml slightly improve efficiency of function calls.

2001-02-21:  Updated README.

2001-02-20:  Added additional checks for increment-parameters: this
             prevents segfaults if the user passes invalid arguments.

             Added new module "vec_SD.ml" and supplementary C-files
             for additional (non-BLAS) vector operations. It currently
             implements "ssqr", "add", "sub", "mul", "div" and "ssqr_diff"
             (see module interface for documentation).

2001-02-09:  Added "asum"-function from BLAS.

2001-02-08:  Added "copy"- and "dot"-functions from BLAS and restructered
             the code a bit to make it more extensible.

2001-01-24:  First release.
