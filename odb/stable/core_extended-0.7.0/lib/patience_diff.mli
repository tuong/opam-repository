(** Bram Cohen's comment from the original Python code (with syntax changed to OCaml):

    [get_matching_blocks a b] returns a list of triples describing matching
    subsequences.

    Each triple is of the form (i, j, n), and means that
    a <|> (i,i+n) = b <|> (j,j+n).  The triples are monotonically increasing in
    i and in j.

    The last triple is a dummy, (Array.length a, Array.length b, 0), and is the only
    triple with n=0.

    Example:
    get_matching_blocks [|"a";"b";"x";"c";"d"|] [|"a";"b";"c";"d"|]
    returns
    [(0, 0, 2), (3, 2, 2), (5, 4, 0)]
*)
module Matching_block : sig
  type t = {
    mine_start  : int;
    other_start : int;
    length      : int;
  }
end

val get_matching_blocks :
  transform: ('a -> 'b)
  -> compare: ('b -> 'b -> int)

val ratio : 'a array -> 'a array -> float

(** For handling diffs abstractly.  A range is a subarray of the two original
    arrays with a constructor defining its relationship to the two original
    arrays.  A [Same] range contains a series of elements which can be found in
    both arrays.  A [New] range contains elements found only in the new array,
    while an [Old] range contains elements found only in the old array.

    A [Replace] contains two arrays: elements in the first array are elements
    found only in the original, old array which have been replaced by elements
    in the second array, which are elements found only in the new array.

*)
module Range : sig
  type 'a t =
      | Same of ('a * 'a) array

      | New of 'a array
      | Replace of 'a array * 'a array
      | Unified of 'a array            
end

(** In diff terms, a hunk is a unit of consecutive ranges with some [Same]
    context before and after [New], [Old], and [Replace] ranges.  Each
    hunk contains information about the original arrays, specifically the
    starting indexes and the number of elements in both arrays to which
    the hunk refers.

    Furthermore, a diff is essentially a list of hunks.  The simplest case
    is a diff with infinite context, consisting of exactly one hunk. *)
module Hunk : sig

    mine_start: int;
    mine_size: int;
    other_start: int;
    other_size: int;

  (** [all_same hunk] returns true if [hunk] contains only Same ranges. *)
  val all_same: 'a t -> bool
end


(** [get_hunks a b ~context ~compare] will compare the arrays [a] and [b] using
    [compare] and produce a list of hunks. (The hunks will contain Same ranges
    of at most [context] elements.)  [context] defaults to infinity (producing a
    singleton hunk list), [compare] defaults to polymorphic compare. *)

(** [get_status hunks] returns `Same if each hunk in [hunks] has only Same ranges. *)
val all_same : 'a Hunk.t list -> bool

(** [unified hunks] converts all Replace ranges in hunks to an Old range
    followed by a New range. *)
val unified : 'a Hunk.t list -> 'a Hunk.t list

(** [old_only hunks] drops all New ranges from hunks and converts all Replace
    ranges to Old ranges. *)
