Dependencies
============
To build this library you need to have OCaml 3.07 and glpk installed.

You can download glpk here: http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html.


Installation
============
As with any oasis project:

  ocaml setup.ml -configure
  ocaml setup.ml -build
  ocaml setup.ml -install


Notes
=====
The bindings are not (yet) complete. If you need a specific function, just mail
me (or send a patch) and I'll add it as soon as possible.


License
=======
The license of this library is the GPL like the original glpk library. It is
therefore useless to ask me to change the license, I can't do that.
