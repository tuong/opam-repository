                 Ocamlscript version 1.99
                 ========================

Disclaimer:
----------
This is a preview release of ocamlscript 2. It is provided for curious
programmers who are interested in testing the new system. Several
incompatible changes might take place between this pre-release and
the 2.0 release line. Be ready to adapt the header of your scripts
when you upgrade!


Installation:
------------

Requirements: 
  * OCaml version 3.08.x or 3.09.x, 
  * GNU make, 
  * Findlib (ocamlfind)

This version has been developed on Linux and will probably not work on the
Win32 port of OCaml, and maybe others. Any help to make that work is
appreciated.

Compilation:
  make

Installation:
  make install

Uninstallation:
  make uninstall

Examples are available in the "examples" subdirectory.
