OCamlscript is a tool which compiles OCaml scripts into native code,
thus combining mthe flexibility of scripts and the speed provided by
ocamlopt.

Ocamlopt 2 is work in progress. An ocamlscript script contains 2
sections: the first section specifies compilation options and
libraries to load, while the second section is the OCaml program.

Examples are given in the "examples" subdirectory.
