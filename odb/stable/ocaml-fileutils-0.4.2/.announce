Subject: [ANN] ocaml-fileutils v0.4.0

Ocaml fileutils is aimed to be a platform independent library to perform
operation on file like:
- mv
- cp
- rm
- mkdir
- touch
- which...

Comes also with a module to manipulate abstract filename:
- classification
- make_relative: made a filename relative to another
- make_absolute

This new release simplify module structure (nested modules are not required
anymore) and comes with a more clear documentation. It also removes
parser/lexer for path which was little bit overkilling. Some operations have
been optimized for speed (like find) -- coming close in term of performance to 
standard POSIX commands.
