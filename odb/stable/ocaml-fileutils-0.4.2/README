ocaml-fileutils
---------------

This library is intended to provide a basic interface to the most
common real file and filename operation. It has filename function
(reduce, make_absolute, make_relative) and real file manipulation
(cp, mv, rm, touch).

It is separated in two modules: FileUtil for real file and FilePath for
filename.

This library is still under developpement. I intend to make it as
portable as possible. In other one, i welcome any bug report from
Windows user, Mac OS user...
